#### Text Summarization API allows you to summarize your text using fine tuned transformer model. ðŸ“‘

## Parameters

To maximize the flexibility of the API, the following parameters are available:
* **text**: The text to summarize.
* **length_penalty**: Exponential penalty to the length. 1.0 means no penalty.
Set to values < 1.0 in order to encourage the model to generate shorter summaries.
* **number_of_beams**: Number of beams for beam search. Must be between 1 and infinity.
The number_of_beams parameter determines how many of these alternative sequences are kept at each step.
A higher num_beams value means that more alternative sequences are explored, which can lead to better results but also requires more computation
* **max_length**: The maximum length of the sequence to be generated. Between 0 and infinity.

#### Terms of Use
Feel free to test the API as much as you want.
